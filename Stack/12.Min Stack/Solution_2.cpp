/*
Solution 2:
Use a second stack with size <= original stack
Same size worst case
Minimum has to be duplicated in helper_stack, otherwise we will remove the minimum too soon and wonâ€™t be able to know the correct minimum anymore
Intuition: Pick a decreasing sequence ending at the current entry in the orignal_stack to the helper_stack
Best input for space usage:
First entry is the minimum value, we only have one entry in the helper_stack!
Worst input for space usage:
Entries are is descending order, we have to keep all entries in the helper_stack! Since the intuition here is picking a decreasing sequence ending at the current entry in the orignal_stack to the helper_stack.
