Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree: root = {6,2,8,0,4,7,9,#,#,3,5}

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

Example
Example 1:

Input: 
{6,2,8,0,4,7,9,#,#,3,5}
2
8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: 
{6,2,8,0,4,7,9,#,#,3,5}
2
4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
