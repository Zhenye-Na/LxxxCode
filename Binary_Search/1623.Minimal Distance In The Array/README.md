# 1623. Minimal Distance In The Array

**Description**

Given two integer arrays `a` and `b`, please find the number in `a` with the minimal distance between corresponding value in `b` (the distance between two numbers means the absolute value of two numbers), if there are several numbers in a have same distance between `b[i]`, just output the smallest number.
Finally, you should output an array of length `b.length` to represent the answer.

```
1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100000
```

**Example**

Example 1

```
Input: a = [5,1,2,3], b = [2,4,2]
Output: [2,3,2]
Explanation: 
b[0]=2, 2 is the number who has the minimal distance to 2
b[1]=4, 3 and 5 have the same distance to 4,output 3 because 3 is smaller
b[2]=2, as well as b[0]
```

Example 2

```
Input: a = [5,3,1,-1,6], b = [4,8,1,1]
Output: [3,6,1,1]
Explanation: 
b[0]=4, 3 and 5 have the same distance to 4,output 3 because 3 is smaller
b[1]=8, 6 is the number who has the minimal distance to 8
b[2]=1, 1 is the number who has the minimal distance to 1
```
