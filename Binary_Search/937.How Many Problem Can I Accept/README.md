# 937. How Many Problem Can I Accept

**Description**


Given a positive integer n representing the time of one competition. The difficulty of the problem in the game is increasing. You need to spend `k Ã— i` time for each question you complete, where `k` is the input coefficient and `i` is the number of the problem (starting from `1`). Find the maximum number of problems you can complete.

`1<=n<=2^61-1 1<=k<=50`


**Example**

Example 1

```
Input: n = 30, k = 1
Output: 7
Explanation:
Because 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 3 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 7 = 28 < 30 and 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 3 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 7 + 1 * 8 = 36 > 30
```

Example 2

```
Input: n = 31, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation:
Because 2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 4 + 2 * 5 = 30 < 31 and 2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 4 + 2 * 5 + 2 * 6 = 42 > 31
```
