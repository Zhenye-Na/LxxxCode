# 1319. Contains Duplicate II

**Description**

Given an array of integers and an integer `k`, find out whether there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] = nums[j]` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.

**Example**

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1], k = 0
Output: False
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1], k = 2
Output: True
Explanation: nums[0] = nums[2] and 2 - 0 <= 2
```
