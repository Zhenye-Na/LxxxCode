# 1802. Grid Game

**Description**

Given a `grid` with `n` rows and `m` columns of binary integers, `0` or `1`, and a set of rules, simulate `k` turns of the game on this grid.

The given `grid` denotes the initial configuration for the game, where `grid[i][j] = 1` denotes that cell in the `i`th row and `j`th column is `alive`, and `grid[i][j] = 0` denotes that this cell is `dead`. Two cells are neighbors when they share at least one common corner, thus each cell has at most 8 neighbors, as shown in the picture below:

There is a list of 9 rules indexed from 0 to 8, each rule having a value of either "alive" or "dead".A single rule,i,specifies what happens to the cells with exactly i alive neighbors.In each turn the new value of a cell is determined by counting the number of "alive" neighbors and applying the rule at index corresponding to the count. The value corresponding to the rule is used to set new value in the cell

The "Live neughbors for each cell" grid at turn 1 contains the number of adjoining live cells at each grid position for turn 0.It is used to create the new grid state for turn 1. At each cell with a value of 3 or 5, the related cell in the new grid is set to alive. All of the others are set to dead, The resultant grid is similarly analyzed for the second turn. The returned 2-dimensional array contains the grid rows shown at turn 2 above.

```
1<= n*m <= 10^3
0 <= k <= 10^3
rules[r] is either "dead" or "alive"(where 0 <= r < 9)
```

**Clarification**

```
Complete the function gridGame in the editor below. The function must return a 2-dimensional integer array.
gridGame has the following parameter(s):
grid[grid[0][0], ..., grid[n-1][m-1]]: a 2D array of integers that denote the original grid
k: an integer that denotes the number of steps to perform
rules[rules[0],....rules[8]]: an array of strings that represent the rules of the game
```

**Example**

```
Example:
input:
grid: [[0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]
rules: ["dead", "dead", "dead", "alive", "dead", "alive", "dead", "dead", "dead"]
turn: 2
output:[[0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]
Explanationï¼š
turn 1:
because live neighbors grid:
[[3, 3, 2, 1],
 [2, 3, 3, 1]]
3 and 5 are alive, thus turn 1 grid is:
[[1, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 1, 0]]

turn 2:
live neighbors grid:
[[2, 3, 3, 1],
 [3, 3, 2, 1]]
thus turn 2 grid is
[[0, 1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0, 0]]
```
